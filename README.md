# TypeScript Code Organizer for VS Code

VS Code extension for keeping your TypeScript code organized by grouping and ordering class members.

TypeScript Code Organizer is a VS Code extension for organizing TypeScript source code in a project workspace. It allows software developers to organize import statements, modules, classes, interfaces and type members and helps them keep their source code more consistent and easier to navigate. It is highly configurable and allows sharing of the configuration across the development team. Everything from import statements, regions, grouping to sorting can be configured! It also comes as a command line tool, see [TypeScript Code Organizer Command Line Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsco-cli).

## Features

Organize currently opened TypeScript file or all TypeScript files in your project.

## Usage

### Command Palette

From the command palette you can:

- create default configuration file by invoking command `TypeScript Code Organizer: Create Configuration File`,
- organize current TypeScript file by invoking command `TypeScript Code Organizer: Organize Current File`,
- organize all TypeScript files in the project by invoking command `TypeScript Code Organizer: Organize All Files`

### Keybboard Shortcuts

You can invoke command `TypeScript Code Organizer: Organize Current File` by using the shortcut `Ctr + Shift + O`. You can change the shortcut by assigning a different shortcut to command "tsco.organize". The shortcut `Ctr + Shift + O` only works if the opened file is a TypeScript file.

### Context Menu

You can invoke command `TypeScript Code Organizer: Organize Current File` by using the context menu item.

## Extension Configuration

Extensions supports the following configuration options:

- `tsco.organizeOnSave`: Organizes TypeScripot code on save (set to false by default).
- `tsco.configurationFilePath`: Specifies the file path to the TSCO configuraiton file. Can be absolute or relative to the workspace root.

## Code Organization Configuration

Code organization is configured by a `tsco.json` configuration file. To create a default TypeScript Code Organizer configuration file, invoke the following command:

![Create Configuration Command](./doc/create_configuration_command.png "Create Configuration Command")

This will create a `tsco.json` file at the workspace root directory. For configuration reference, see [TypeScript Code Organizer Configuration Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsco-cli). The configuration file should be commited to the repository and shared with team members to ensure consistent code organization configuration. If you would like to specify an alternative location for the configuration file, you con do it using `tsco.configurationFilePath` setting. If no configuration file is found, TSCO will look in the parent directory until `tsco.json` or the root of file system is found. If `tsco.json` is not found, the default configuration will be used.

## Ignoring files

In order to prevent a TypeScript file being organized you can add the file to the exclude list in the configuration file files section or add one of the following comments to the top of the TypeScript file:

```typescript
// tsco:ignore
```

or

```typescript
// <auto-generated />
```

## Debugging TSCO

If you have issues with TSCO, like not using the correct configuration file, you can use tye output window to investigate issues:
